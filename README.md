# Akhil, Karthik, Isaac, Krishna 2.3.1: Autonomous Local Road Navigation with Traffic Law Compliance

## Overview

This project focuses on creating an autonomous robot capable of navigating local roads while obeying traffic laws and responding to dynamic obstacles, such as traffic lights and pedestrians. Unlike current systems like Tesla's Autopilot, which still require driver intervention on local roads, our solution is designed to seamlessly adapt to user-inputted maps and handle obstacles efficiently, making the bot a truly autonomous solution for local road navigation.

## Problem Statement

There is a clear need for autonomous vehicles (AVs) that can safely navigate local roads without requiring constant human intervention. Existing systems, such as Tesla, still struggle with driving on local roads due to inaccuracies in navigation, especially when dealing with complex traffic rules and real-world obstacles.

## Product

Our autonomous robot is designed to:

- Adapt to a user-inputted map.
- Navigate the map while avoiding traffic violations.
- Respond to traffic signals, stopping at red lights and moving at green.
- Stop for pedestrians crossing the road.
- Accept basic movement commands such as forward, left, and right.
- Work seamlessly in real-world environments with dynamic obstacles.

## Features

- **Driving:**
  - Navigate based on user-defined routes.
  - Handle standard movement commands like forward, left, and right.
- **Map Making:**
  - User can input and customize the map for the robot to navigate.
- **Route Management:**
  - Add, change, or delete routes.
- **Traffic Laws Compliance:**
  - Stop at red lights.
  - Start at green lights.
  - Stop for pedestrians crossing the road.
